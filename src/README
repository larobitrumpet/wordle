# Wordle

A program that solves Wordle. Has 3 modes, run, play, test.

## Run

Pass `run` as a command line argument, or without any command line arguments. Simply an implementation of Wordle, but also shows the optimal word, a list of possible words, and the possible letters for each possition.

## Play

Pass `play` as a command line argument. The program plays wordle, suggesting an optimal word, and the user provides the color sequence for that word from an implementation of wordle. The color sequence is entered as five characters, 'g' for green, 'y' for yellow, and 'b' for black.

## Test

Tests itself against every single possible word and prints it's average score.

## First optimal word

Since it takes so long and doesn't change, the first optimal was computed and then hard coded in. If you with to compute the first optimal word as well, simply uncomment the relevent lines in `src/game.rs`, `src/play.rs`, and `src/test.rs` and the line after for each of the 3 modes (run, play, and test respectfully).
